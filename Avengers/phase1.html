<h2><p id="top"><u>IRON MAN(2008)</u></p></h2>

<p><b><u>.Billionaire industrialist</u> </b>Tony Stark builds himself a suit of armor after he is taken captive by a terrorist organization. Free from his captors, he decides to upgrade and don his armor in order to hunt down weapons that were sold under the table.</p>
<p><b><u>.In April 2006,</u></b> Marvel hired Jon Favreau to direct Iron Man,[17] with the writing teams of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing competing scripts.[17][30] Favreau consolidated both into one script, which was then polished by John August.[18] Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the title role in September 2006, after growing out a goatee and working out to convince the filmmakers he was right for the part.</p>
<p><b><u>.The film ends</u></b> with a post-credits scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, who approaches Stark regarding the "Avenger Initiative". Favreau said that he included the scene as "a little tip of the hat for the fans.a way to sort of tee up The Avengers. with a skeleton crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking. Captain America's shield is also visible in the background of a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.</p>

<p><b><u>After being exposed</u></b> to gamma radiation that causes him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross. Hunted by the military, Banner seeks to cure himself and prevent his condition from being weaponized</p>
<p><b><u>In January 2006,</u></b>[44] Marvel reclaimed the film rights for the Hulk character from Universal Pictures after Universal failed to meet a deadline to develop a sequel to director Ang Lee's 2003 film Hulk.[45] Universal retained distribution rights for future Hulk films.[45] Instead of moving forward with a sequel, Marvel hired Louis Leterrier to direct The Incredible Hulk, a reboot.[19] Leterrier initially turned down the job out of respect for Lee, but later reconsidered and signed on.[19] The script was written by Zak Penn, who drafted a treatment for the 2003 film.</p>
<p><b><u>The film takes </u></b>place simultaneously with the events of Iron Man 2 and Thor,[52] the former of which is set six months after the events of Iron Man.[53] Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance at the end of the film. Downey said that the filmmakers "were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach [actor William Hurt's character General Ross], and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. </p>

<p><b><u>After Tony Stark</U></b> reveals himself to be Iron Man, the U.S. government demands he hand over his technology. Meanwhile, a rival industrialist and a Russian scientist conspire to use his own technology against him.[56]
Immediately following the successful release of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced it was developing a sequel, Iron Man 2.[57] Favreau returned as director[21] and Justin Theroux was hired to write the screenplay, which would be based on an original story by Favreau and Downey.[22] In October 2008, Downey signed a new four-picture deal, that retroactively included the first film, to reprise his role and Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard as James Rhodes.[58][59] Jackson signed on to reprise his role as Nick Fury from the Iron Man post-credits sequence in up to nine films,[60] and Scarlett.</p>
<p><b><u>The majority</u> </b>of filming took place at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, California.[64] Other locations included Edwards Air Force Base,[65] Monaco,[66] and the Sepulveda Dam.[64] Iron Man 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 26, 2010,[67] and was released internationally between April 28 and May 7 before releasing in the United States on May 7.[68]
The film is set six months after the events of Iron Man,[53] and takes place simultaneously with the events of The Incredible Hulk and Thor.[52] The filmmakers continued to refer to other Marvel films by again including Captain America's shield. </p>
<p><b><u>Favreau explained,</u></b> "We introduced Captain America's shield briefly in one shot in the last film. So now it really was in his room, so we had to figure out how to deal with the reality that the shield was in his workshop."[42] A scene toward the end of Iron Man 2 in a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house contains several Easter eggs, ranging from footage from The Incredible Hulk displayed on a monitor to pointers on a map indicating several locales related to other Marvel films, including one pointing toward a region of Africa in reference to the Black Panther.[69] A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by Spider-Man actor Tom Holland,</p>
